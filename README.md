###  Project Overview

**RapidFireQuiz** is a time-bound quiz platform that:
- Collects user email before starting
- Fetches 15 random questions from the [Open Trivia DB API](https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=15)
- Shows a **30-minute countdown timer**
- Allows navigation between questions
- Indicates visited and attempted questions
- Auto-submits when time is up
- Generates a result report comparing user answers with correct ones

---

###  My Approach

The app is divided into logical, reusable components:
- `StartPage`: Email input and quiz start button
- `QuizPage`: Timer, questions, and navigation
- `QuestionCard`: Renders question and randomized options
- `NavigatorPanel`: Shows which questions are visited/answered
- `ResultPage`: Displays submitted answers with correctness indicators

All UI styling is handled using **Tailwind CSS** utility classes for rapid and responsive design.
